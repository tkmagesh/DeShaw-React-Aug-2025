## What is React?
- JS library for building UI
- Specialized for building SPA

## SOLID Principles
- S -> Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) [*]
- O -> Open Closed Principle (OCP) [*] 
- L -> Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP)
- I -> Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- D -> Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) [*]

## React
- Helps in creating Views (Components)
- Component 
    - Encapsulates Presentation + UI Logic + State
    - Rerender the whole presentation when the `state` is changing
- Uses VDOM to optimize the rendering of the UI

### JSX
| HTML | JSX |
| ---- | ---- |
| Can have tags without the corresponding close tags | Every tag must have the corresponding close tag |
| Can use `class` attribute | Use `className` instead of `class` |
| Can use `for` attribute | Use `htmlFor` instead of `for` |
